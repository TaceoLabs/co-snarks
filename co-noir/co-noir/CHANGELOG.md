# Changelog

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/co-snarks/compare/co-noir-v0.4.0...co-noir-v0.5.0) (2024-12-18)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Align to upstream bb behavior of calculating the grand product argument only over the relevant trace size, which leads to a different proof being output.
* Bump Noir to v0.38.0, implement range checks, and allow nargo-asserts
* Add more commands to co-noir binary to prepare for cases where
* co-noir adapted to ACVMType instead of sharedbuildervariable
* Use ACVMType in co-builder
* MpcNetworkHandler::establish now takes the config with already read certs and key.
* The interface of the UltraCircuitVariable trait has change. Thus, also ProvingKey::create() throws an error now.
* co-noir now stores shared inputs in a different format (`BTreeMap<String, Rep3AcvmType<ark_bn254::Fr>>` instead of `BTreeMap<String, Rep3PrimeFieldShare<ark_bn254::Fr>>`)
* The produced proofs are now different due to new transcript handling in bb 0.55.1, and they are no longer backwards compatible.
* Add merging inputs to co-noir binary ([#208](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/co-snarks/issues/208))
