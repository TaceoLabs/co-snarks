## [0.3.0](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/co-snarks/compare/co-noir-v0.2.0...co-noir-v0.3.0) (2024-11-12)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Add more commands to co-noir binary to prepare for cases where
* co-noir adapted to ACVMType instead of sharedbuildervariable
* Use ACVMType in co-builder
* MpcNetworkHandler::establish now takes the config with already read certs and key.
* The interface of the UltraCircuitVariable trait has change. Thus, also ProvingKey::create() throws an error now.
* co-noir now stores shared inputs in a different format (`BTreeMap<String, Rep3AcvmType<ark_bn254::Fr>>` instead of `BTreeMap<String, Rep3PrimeFieldShare<ark_bn254::Fr>>`)
* The produced proofs are now different due to new transcript handling in bb 0.55.1, and they are no longer backwards compatible.

### Features
