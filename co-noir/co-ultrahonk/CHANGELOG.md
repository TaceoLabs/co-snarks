## [0.2.0](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/co-snarks/compare/co-ultrahonk-v0.1.0...co-ultrahonk-v0.2.0) (2024-11-11)


### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* Add more commands to co-noir binary to prepare for cases where
* Use ACVMType in co-builder
* Move builder to new co-builder crate
* removed point G2 from ultra-honk prover
* The interface of the UltraCircuitVariable trait has change. Thus, also ProvingKey::create() throws an error now.
* The produced proofs are now different due to new transcript handling in bb 0.55.1, and they are no longer backwards compatible.
