  * dependencies
    * circom-types bumped from 0.2.0 to 0.3.0
    * mpc-core bumped from 0.2.0 to 0.2.1

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/collaborative-circom/compare/co-groth16-v0.3.0...co-groth16-v0.4.0) (2024-08-14)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* We renamed all crate names from collaborative-* to co-* for brevity, and also shortened `Collaborative` to `Co` in many types.

### Code Refactoring

* renamed crates to co-* ([#161](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/collaborative-circom/issues/161)) ([37f3493](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/collaborative-circom/commit/37f3493b25e41b43bbc8a89e281ae2dcb4b95484))

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/collaborative-circom/compare/collaborative-groth16-v0.2.1...collaborative-groth16-v0.3.0) (2024-08-14)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* moved common code for PLONK and Groth16 into separate crate. Most notably the SharedWitness and SharedInput
* Make MPC-VM thread safe and implement better Clone for shared inputs and witnesses ([#158](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/collaborative-circom/issues/158))
* PLONK uses the witness struct, therefore we moved it from Groth16 to one level higher
* removed files that were used by arkworks groth16
* we hide the modules defining the zkey, proof, vk, and witness and use pub use the re-export them
* the verifier (and the arkwork dep) is now hidden behind the "verifier" feature. Also we refactored some stuff in Groth16 to mirror PLONK.
* share_rep3 and share_shamir interfaces changed
* Adds a method to the ArkworksPairingBridge trait

### Features

* add deserialization of plonk circom types ([d1f0d4d](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/collaborative-circom/commit/d1f0d4dd5ac63e85523c139e573161bd2ff0061a))
