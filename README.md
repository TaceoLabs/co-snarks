**coCircom** is a tool for building **coSNARKs**, a new technology that enables
multiple distrusting parties to collaboratively compute a **zero-knowledge proof**
(ZKP). It leverages the existing domain-specific language
[circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom) to define arithmetic circuits. With
coCircom, all existing Circom circuits can be promoted to coSNARKs without any
modification to the original circuit.

Additionally, coCircom is fully compatible with the **Groth16** backend of
[snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs), the native proofing system for
Circom. Proofs built with coCircom can be verified using snarkjs, and vice
versa.

The project is built with pure Rust and consists of multiple libraries:

- **circom-mpc-vm**: A MPC-VM that executes the circom file in a distributed
  manner (building the extended witness).
- **circom-mpc-compiler**: A compiler that generates the MPC-VM code from the
  circom file.
- **circom-types**: A library for serialization and deserialization of snarkjs
  artifacts, such as ZKeys and R1CS files.
- **collaborative-groth16**: A library for verifying and proofing a Groth16
  coSNARK, verifiable by snarkjs.

The following libraries are agnostic to coCircom and will be used in the future
for other coSNARKs:

- **mpc-core**: Implementation of MPC protocols.
- **mpc-net**: Network library for MPC protocols.

The binary `collaborative-circom` is a CLI tool that uses the libraries to build
a coSNARK.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Install Rust. You can find the instructions
   [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

1. You can find the latest release
   [here](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/collaborative-circom/releases/latest).
2. Download the binary for your machine.

3. Make the binary executable (if necessary):

```bash
chmod +x collaborative-circom
```

### Install from Source:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TaceoLabs/collaborative-circom.github
```

2. Build the project:

```bash
cd collaborative-circom && cargo build --release
```

## Documentation

You can find the documentation of coCircom [here](https://docs.taceo.io/).

## CLI Usage

This section covers the necessary steps to build a coSNARK using the previously
installed coCircom binary. For demonstration purposes, we will use a simple
circuit called `adder.circom`.

```c++
pragma circom 2.0.0;

template Adder() {
    signal input a;
    signal input b;
    signal output c;

    c <== a + b;
}
component main = Adder();
```

With this circuit, we can prove that we know two numbers that sum up to `c`.
While this is a basic example, it is sufficient for demonstration purposes. We
will use a replicated secret sharing scheme with 3 parties for all steps
(denoted as REP3 in the commands).

### Step 1: Generate the R1CS File

First, we need to generate the R1CS file from the Circom file. We use Circom for
this step:

```bash
circom adder.circom --r1cs
```

### Step 2: Perform Groth16 Setup

Next, we need to perform the Groth16 setup using Circom and snarkjs. Refer to
the
[circom documentation](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/proving-circuits/)
for detailed instructions up to the "generate proof" section.

For the following steps, we call the ZKey file `adder.zkey`.

### Step 3: Prepare the Input

This step involves handling inputs from either a single party or multiple
distrusting parties.

#### Single Party Input

If the input comes from a single party, we simply split (secret-share) the
input. Assume we have a file named `input.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "a": "3",
  "b": "4"
}
```

To split the input, use the following command:

```bash
mkdir out && ./co-circom split-input --circuit adder.circom --input input.json --protocol REP3 --out-dir out/
```

This command will generate secret-shared inputs in the `out` directory, one for
each party.

#### Multiple Party Input

When the input comes from multiple parties, each party first secret-shares their
respective inputs locally. For example, consider two input files: `input0.json`:

```json
{
  "a": "3"
}
```

`input1.json`:

```json
{
  "b": "4"
}
```

In practice, these files would typically reside on different machines. Each
party secret-shares their input individually:

```bash
mkdir out && ./co-circom split-input --circuit adder.circom --input input0.json --protocol REP3 --out-dir out/
```

The parties then send their shares to the computing nodes, which can merge the
shares. All computing nodes execute the following command (provided here for the
first party):

```bash
mkdir out0 && ./co-circom merge-input-shares --inputs out/input0.json.0.shared --inputs out/input1.json.0.shared --protocol REP3 --out out0/input.json.0.shared
```

### Step 4: Extended Witness Generation

To generate the witness, we execute the circuit with the secret-shared input
obtained from the previous step. Additionally, computing nodes require
networking configuration files and TLS key material. Examples of these
configurations can be found in the
[configs](/collaborative-circom/examples/configs) and key materials in the
[keys](/collaborative-circom/examples/data) directory. Refer to our
[documentation](https://docs.taceo.io/network-config.html) for detailed
configuration instructions.

All parties execute the following command (provided here for the first party):

```bash
./co-circom generate-witness --input out0/input.json.0.shared --circuit adder.circom --protocol REP3 --config configs/party1.toml --out out0/witness.wtns.0.shared
```

**Note**: You need to execute three nodes in parallel. This command will block
until all nodes have finished, so you will likely need three separate terminals
;)

### Step 5: Generate the Proof

Next, we generate the proof. Each computing node executes the following command:

```bash
./co-circom generate-proof --witness out0/witness.wtns.0.shared --zkey adder.zkey --protocol REP3 --config configs/party1.toml --out proof.0.json --public-input public_input.0.json
```

Remember to execute this command on all three nodes.

### Step 6: Verify the Proof

You can verify the proof using either coCircom or snarkjs. Here's the command
for using coCircom:

```bash
./co-circom verify --proof proof.0.json --vk verification_key.json --public-input public_input.0.json
```

**Note**: The `verification_key.json` was generated in Step 2.
