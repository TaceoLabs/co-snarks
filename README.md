**coCircom** and **coNoir** are tools for building **coSNARKs**, a new technology that enables
multiple distrusting parties to collaboratively compute a **zero-knowledge
proof** (ZKP). They leverage the existing domain-specific languages
[circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom) and [Noir](https://github.com/noir-lang/noir) to define arithmetic circuits. With
coCircom, all existing circom circuits can be promoted to coSNARKs without any
modification to the original circuit.

Additionally, coCircom is fully compatible with the **Groth16** and **Plonk** backends of
[snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs), the native proving systems for
circom. Proofs built with coCircom can be verified using snarkjs, and vice
versa.

The project is built with pure Rust and consists of multiple libraries:

- **circom-mpc-vm**: A MPC-VM that executes the circom file in a distributed
  manner (building the extended witness).
- **circom-mpc-compiler**: A compiler that generates the MPC-VM code from the
  circom file.
- **circom-types**: A library for serialization and deserialization of snarkjs
  artifacts, such as ZKeys and R1CS files.
- **co-groth16**: A library for verifying and proving a Groth16
  coSNARK, verifiable by snarkjs.
- **co-plonk**: A library for verifying and proving a Plonk
  coSNARK, verifiable by snarkjs.
- **co-circom-snarks**: A library for the shared code of co-plonk and co-groth16.

The following libraries are agnostic to coCircom and will be used in the future
for other coSNARKs:

- **mpc-core**: Implementation of MPC protocols.
- **mpc-net**: Network library for MPC protocols.

The binary `co-circom` is a CLI tool that uses the libraries to build a coSNARK
(source found in the **co-circom** folder).

## Documentation

You can find the documentation of coCircom [here](https://docs.taceo.io/).

## CLI Usage

This section covers the necessary steps to build a Groth16 coSNARK using the previously
installed coCircom binary. For demonstration purposes, we will use a simple
circuit called `adder.circom`.

```c++
pragma circom 2.0.0;

template Adder() {
    signal input a;
    signal input b;
    signal output c;

    c <== a + b;
}
component main = Adder();
```

With this circuit, we can prove that we know two numbers that sum up to `c`.
While this is a basic example, it is sufficient for demonstration purposes. We
will use a replicated secret sharing scheme with 3 parties for all steps
(denoted as REP3 in the commands).

### Step 1: Generate the R1CS File

First, we need to generate the R1CS file from the circom file. We use circom for
this step:

```bash
circom adder.circom --r1cs
```

### Step 2: Perform Groth16 Setup

Next, we need to perform the Groth16 setup using circom and snarkjs. Refer to
the
[circom documentation](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/proving-circuits/)
for detailed instructions up to the "Generating a Proof" section.

For the following steps, we call the ZKey file `adder.zkey`.

### Step 3: Prepare the Input

This step involves handling inputs from either a single party or multiple
distrusting parties.

#### Input from a Single Party

If the input comes from a single party, we simply split (secret-share) the
input. Assume we have a file named `input.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "a": "3",
  "b": "4"
}
```

To split the input, use the following command:

```bash
mkdir out && ./co-circom split-input --circuit adder.circom --input input.json --protocol REP3 --curve BN254 --out-dir out/
```

This command will generate secret-shared inputs in the `out` directory, creating separate files for each party. These files will be named `input.json.0.shared`, `input.json.1.shared`, and `input.json.2.shared`, corresponding to the shares for each respective party.

**Note**: In practice, it is crucial that each party has exclusive access to their respective file. Sharing these files across parties compromises the security of the shared witness.

#### Input from Multiple Parties

When the input comes from multiple parties, each party first secret-shares their
respective inputs locally. For example, consider two input files: `input0.json`:

```json
{
  "a": "3"
}
```

`input1.json`:

```json
{
  "b": "4"
}
```

In practice, these files would typically reside on different machines. Each
party secret-shares their input individually:

```bash
mkdir out && ./co-circom split-input --circuit adder.circom --input input0.json --protocol REP3 --curve BN254 --out-dir out/
```

The parties then send their shares to the computing nodes, which can merge the
shares. All computing nodes execute the following command (provided here for the
first party):

```bash
./co-circom merge-input-shares --inputs out/input0.json.0.shared --inputs out/input1.json.0.shared --protocol REP3 --curve BN254 --out out/input.json.0.shared
```

### Step 4: Extended Witness Generation

To generate the witness, we execute the circuit with the secret-shared input
obtained from the previous step. Additionally, computing nodes require
networking configuration files and TLS key material. Examples of these
configurations can be found in the
[configs](/co-circom/examples/configs) and key materials in the
[keys](/co-circom/examples/data) directory. Refer to our
[documentation](https://docs.taceo.io/network-config.html) for detailed
configuration instructions.

All parties execute the following command (provided here for the first party):

```bash
./co-circom generate-witness --input out/input.json.0.shared --circuit adder.circom --protocol REP3 --curve BN254 --config configs/party1.toml --out out/witness.wtns.0.shared
```

**Note**: You need to execute three nodes in parallel. This command will block
until all nodes have finished, so you will likely need three separate terminals
;)

### Step 5: Generate the Proof

Next, we generate the proof. Each computing node executes the following command:

```bash
./co-circom generate-proof groth16 --witness out/witness.wtns.0.shared --zkey adder.zkey --protocol REP3 --curve BN254 --config configs/party1.toml --out proof.0.json --public-input public_input.0.json
```

Remember to execute this command on all three nodes.

### Step 6: Verify the Proof

You can verify the proof using either coCircom or snarkjs. Here's the command
for using coCircom:

```bash
./co-circom verify groth16 --proof proof.0.json --vk verification_key.json --public-input public_input.0.json --curve BN254
```

**Note**: The `verification_key.json` was generated in Step 2.

For more examples, please refer to the
[examples folder](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/co-snarks/tree/main/co-circom/co-circom/examples). You'll find bash scripts
there that demonstrate all the necessary steps, as well as scripts for using Plonk instead of Groth16.
