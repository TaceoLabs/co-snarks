# Examples

This section shows how to use the co-circom CLI to generate proofs for different
circuits. Example bash scripts are available in the `examples` directory of the
[co-circom repository](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/collaborative-circom/tree/main/co-circom/co-circom/examples).

You will also find [configs](./config.md), TLS keys, and sample
inputs for these circuits.
