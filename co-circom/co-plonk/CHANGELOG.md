## 0.1.0 (2024-08-14)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* to unify Groth16 and PLONK we now take the zkey as ref in PLONK when calling prove
* moved common code for PLONK and Groth16 into separate crate. Most notably the SharedWitness and SharedInput
* PLONK uses the witness struct, therefore we moved it from Groth16 to one level higher
* we hide the modules defining the zkey, proof, vk, and witness and use pub use the re-export them
* the verifier (and the arkwork dep) is now hidden behind the "verifier" feature. Also we refactored some stuff in Groth16 to mirror PLONK.

### Features

* plonk support ([9b65797](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/collaborative-circom/commit/9b6579724f6f5ba4fc6af8a98d386b96818dc08b))
